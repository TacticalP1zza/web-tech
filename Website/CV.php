               <p>As a Senoir cadet one of my roles was the mangement and maintenance of Flight Simulators.
                The flight simulators consisted of multiple Desktop computers and a Vr system.
                It was also my role to teach junior Cadets proper use of the system and flight training.

              <p>Through the Mod ComputerCraft, I automated low-level tasks in the game known as "Minecraft".
                The mod allows for the programming of 'Turtles'. Through turtles and the programming language lua,
                I optimized the automation of mining, through a linear searching algorithim and the turtle.detect() function.
                This allowed the turtle to mine every ore in a ore vein and reset to a initial position. As well as a return function
                to return to a home position and deposit gathered resources.

               <h3>RNG Manipulation of Pokemon Heartgold and Soul Silver</h3>
              <p>Game devolpers all have a different approach to implementing randomness or 'Luck' in their games. In the game Pokemon Heartgold they use a Linear Congruential random number generator.
                A seed is decided by what system time you load the ds game and what frame you lauch the game from the main menu.
                Both of these systems can be controlled by you, by changing the system time to a specific time and hitting a specific frame you can force your game to start on
            a specific seed. This allows you to Force every event in the game, as all events such as a pokemon encounter and the stats of the pokemon encountered is determined by
            your seed and current frame which starts at 0, and adds one for every roaming pokemon on the map at start. I have used this to obtain legal comptievely viable pokemon,
            cutting down hundreds of hours of grinding down to just a few minutes of work.</p>
